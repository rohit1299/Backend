We learned to use basic SQL queries in Postregres as well.

How to create table ? ex - CREATE TABLE LEARN(
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    NAME TEXT NOT NULL,
    AGE INT NOT NULL,
    ADDRESS CHAR(50),
    SALARY REAL
);


Now insert values to it -  ex - INSERT INTO TABLE(col1, col2, col3, col4) VALUES (val1, val2, val3, val4);



HOW to access values -  ex - 
SELECT * FROM COMPANY;

SELECT NAME FROM COMPANY;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "RECORDS" FROM COMPANY;

SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 AND SALARY < 100000;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;

Delete - DELETE COMPANY SET SALARY = 15000 WHERE ID = 3;
